# Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-linear-regression
The provided code employs Linear Regression to predict wine quality using a dataset. Initial data analysis explores feature distributions and correlations. Classification models are developed to predict wine quality and determine good quality wines. Linear Regression models are built for both classification and numerical prediction. RMSE is used to assess model performance, and residual analysis is performed. However, the report acknowledges limitations of linear models in capturing complex relationships within the data. Despite high RMSE, the code showcases Linear Regression's application, highlighting the need for more sophisticated methods for accurate wine quality prediction.
